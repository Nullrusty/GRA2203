    <h2>Biography</h2>
	  <content>
		  <p>Jose Marrero has always liked art as far is he can remember. He loves the result but hates the process of getting there. Often at times frustrated with repeating steps in the process only to get a result that does not satisfy him. Yet, despite all the stress this causes he still enjoys creating things in his on way. Typically, structured and symmetrical, which tends to become apparent in website designs. They tend have borders surrounding images and text, but vary from one to another things such as color, size, and animations. Designing websites is where he has found his middle ground between the freedom of the heart and the organized mind.</p>

    <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
	  <content>
		  <p>Most works are either based on something seen in real life or something imagined that’s geometrical and uniform. It could be a cloud, a rose, or a simple puddle or collection of rain drops. Other times it’s a series of repeating shapes trying to form a structure or have some semblance of balance, even with motion at times. A constant fight between realism and personal desire for symmetry and order often leads to a mix of both creating something interesting. Maintaining balance and not leaning entirely towards that of perfection is what ends up yielding the best results.</p>
